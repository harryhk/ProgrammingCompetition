This is a collection of programming competitions that I participated. 

Hackerrank: not fun after while. Some of the algorithm challenge part are very hard to beat. 

googleCodeJam: Had a lot of fun there, even was eliminated in round1. 

rpiUPE: It brought me to programming competition world. Haven't won any prize yet, but I am getting better and better each time.
